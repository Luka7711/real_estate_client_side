## Description

The Ziplow is replication of popular real estate application Zillow. I was motivated to replicate
and rebuild application from scratch with React and Node with additional features.
<br/>
The main takeaways from this project were to learn how to:

- Caintain complex React states using Redux library
- Build reusable React components
- Write unit and integration tests
- Integrate analytical data in charts and graphs
